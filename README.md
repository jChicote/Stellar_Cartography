<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Creation of local maps and interstellar analysis of the local stellar neighbourhood. This may be extended to included data included from NASA databases and missions.

The project is a mini project that endeavors into the development of stellar cartographics of astroinomical bodies including: stars, planets, coments and other celestial bodies within the 70 light-years relative to our sun. This project was inspired from Star Trek's stellar cartography and aims to provide near accurate scaling and representation of astronimical entities and providing relative mapping and basic analysis of the subject entity and other characteristics.
